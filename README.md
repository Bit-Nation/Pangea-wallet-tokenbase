# tokenbase

A repository of ERC20 token information. Tokens listed are on the Pangea wallet. We welcome contributions! ðŸŽ‰

To request adding your ERC20 token to the Pangea wallet, open an Issue in this repository, with the following information:

* Name of token
* Token ticker
* Token address
* Website
* Email address
* A short summary about the token
* A short summary about your organization

At this time we only accept ERC20 tokens, but we're planning to integrate other standards and chains in the future.

Thank you!
